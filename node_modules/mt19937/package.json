Before genrand(), sgenrand(seed) must be      */\n/* called once. (seed is any 32-bit integer except for 0).     */\n/* Integer generator is obtained by modifying two lines.       */\n/*   Coded by Takuji Nishimura, considering the suggestions by */\n/* Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in July-Aug. 1997.           */\n\n/* This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or   */\n/* modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public     */\n/* License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either    */\n/* version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later         */\n/* version.                                                        */\n/* This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, */\n/* but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  */\n/* MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.            */\n/* See the GNU Library General Public License for more details.    */\n/* You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General      */\n/* Public License along with this library; if not, write to the    */\n/* Free Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA   */ \n/* 02111-1307  USA                                                 */\n\n/* Copyright (C) 1997 Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.       */\n/* Any feedback is very welcome.
